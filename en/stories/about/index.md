## Who am I?
My name is Jiaqi Li, I am a recent graduate Computer Science student with a MSc (Distinction) degree from University of Oxford and a First Class BSc Honours degree from University of Nottingham. Looking to secure a software engineer position in the UK or China, where I can bring my technical skills and enthusiasm. You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alexjiaqili).

During my study at Oxford, my research focus was on 3D model visualization, more specifically, model simplification for large objects. Before moving to Oxford, I spent two years at the University of Nottingham (UoN) as an undergraduate student, where I did my BSc thesis on developing intelligent agents using reinforcement learning algorithms to play Angry Birds game. Prior to that, I was in UoN's Ningbo campus, where I engaged in some entrepreneurial activities and worked from many large student organizations. 

## About Virtual World
This website is currently a blog about my notes of study, which I think might be useful to someone who is studying a Computer Science degree. Later on, I will add more stuff, e.g., projects. 

Ideally, every post has both Chinese and English version, but due to the lack of time, some posts (actually all of them so far) are in one language only. Please send me an email if you need a different language version.
